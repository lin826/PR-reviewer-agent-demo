 The numeric mode (i.e. ``0o644``) to set newly uploaded files to. For
 more information about what these modes mean, see the documentation for
 :func:`os.chmod`.
 
-If this isn't given or is ``None``, you'll get operating-system

-of ``0o600``, and files saved from memory will be saved using the
-system's standard umask.
+If you leave this ``None`` (by overriding in your own settings), you'll
+get platform-dependent behavior: temporary files often default to
+``0o600`` and in-memory saves follow your umask (commonly ending up
+``0o644``).
 
 For security reasons, these permissions aren't applied to the temporary files
 that are stored in :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR`.
