 --------------------------------
 
 There are a few settings which control Django's file upload behavior. See
 :ref:`File Upload Settings <file-upload-settings>` for details.
 
+By default, uploaded files have permissions set to 0o644 which allows the file owner
+to read and write, and others to read. You can change this behavior by setting the
+:setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.
+
+.. note::
+   If you explicitly set :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to ``None``, Django will
+   use the system's umask when creating the file. However, be aware that the permissions
+   of the final file may be different depending on whether a :class:`MemoryUploadedFile`
+   or a :class:`TemporaryUploadedFile` was used. This is because the
+   :class:`TemporaryUploadedFile` uses the :mod:`tempfile` module, which sets more
+   restrictive file permissions for security reasons. To ensure consistent file
+   permissions, it's recommended to set :setting:`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` explicitly.
